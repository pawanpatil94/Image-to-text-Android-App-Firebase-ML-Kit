# Image-to-text-Android-App-Firebase-ML-Kit
The project aims to explore Firebase's new ML Kit released by Google. 
ML Kit's text recognition API is used to identify text in images. The app attempts to click a picture using inbuilt camera and tries to detect the text in the image and displays it in the text view.
